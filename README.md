# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program


## Overview

This project offers a **complete, hands-on journey** to design, implement, and fabricate a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)**.

It is designed for **students, educators, and professionals** aiming to master **end-to-end chip development**—from RTL design to post-silicon validation.  

The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** is a national-level initiative in India to empower engineering students with **authentic VLSI experience**, enabling them to move beyond simulation to actual silicon fabrication (tapeout).  

The program brings together students, academic institutions, and national foundries to drive the next wave of innovation in VLSI.

## Program Vision

- Establish a **scalable and replicable reference tapeout program** that serves as a national framework for colleges and universities across India.  
- Build a **proven, reusable methodology** for end-to-end chip development—from RTL design to silicon tapeout.  
- Enable academic institutions to adopt **industry-standard tools and PDKs** to execute their own production-grade RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Programs.  
- Nurture a **skilled pool of silicon designers** capable of real-world chip design and fabrication.

## Program Description

- **Duration:** 20 weeks  
- **Scope:** Demonstrates a complete tapeout cycle for a RISC-V Reference SoC using **Open Source tools** and the **SCL180 nm PDK**.  
- **Workflow:** End-to-end flow from **RTL to GDSII** and **post-silicon validation**.  
- **Format:** Combines online training modules with **physical execution at IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN)**.  
- **Outcome:** A **reusable, documented flow** that sets the standard for academic silicon tapeouts in India.  

This program equips participants with **practical skills**, industry-standard methodology, and the confidence to contribute to the semiconductor ecosystem.
