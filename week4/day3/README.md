# Velocity Saturation Effect

## 1. The effect

In MOSFET devices, as technology scales down into the nanometer regime, the **electric field** across the channel increases significantly for a given drain-to-source voltage (V<sub>DS</sub>). This strong electric field causes the **carrier drift velocity** to no longer increase linearly with field, leading to what is known as the **velocity saturation effect**.

## 2. Long Channel vs Short Channel Devices

| Parameter | Long Channel Device (> 250 nm) | Short Channel Device (< 250 nm) |
|------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Dominant Mechanism** | Channel pinch-off controls saturation | Velocity saturation dominates |
| **Carrier Velocity (v)** | v = μE (linear increase with field) | v → v<sub>sat</sub> (saturates at high field) |
| **Drain Current (I<sub>D</sub>) Dependence** | I<sub>D</sub> ∝ (V<sub>GS</sub> − V<sub>TH</sub>)² | I<sub>D</sub> ∝ (V<sub>GS</sub> − V<sub>TH</sub>) |
| **Saturation Mechanism** | Channel pinch-off near drain | Velocity saturation near drain |
| **Impact** | Higher transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>), quadratic I–V | Reduced g<sub>m</sub>, linear I–V |
| **Short Channel Effects** | Negligible | Significant (DIBL, V<sub>TH</sub> roll-off, etc.) |

## 3. Operation Regions

- Thus, short channel devices have 4 modes while long channel devices have the 3 traditonal modes.

When **(V<sub>GS</sub> − V<sub>T</sub>) = V<sub>GT</sub>**, the drain current can be expressed as:

\[
I_D = k_n \cdot \left[ (V_{GT} \cdot V_{min}) - \frac{V_{min}^2}{2} \right] \cdot (1 + \lambda V_{DS})
\]
where  
\[
V_{min} = \min(V_{GT}, V_{DS}, V_{DS,sat})
\]

## 4. Effect on I–V Characteristics

### (a) I<sub>D</sub>–V<sub>GS</sub> Characteristics

**Figure 2:** I<sub>D</sub> vs V<sub>GS</sub> for long and short channel devices  
![ID vs VGS Characteristics](images/velocity_dat_eff_idvsVgs.png)

In **Figure 2**, we observe the drain current (I<sub>D</sub>) versus gate voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) for:

- **Left:** Long channel device (W = 1.8 µm, L = 1.2 µm)  
- **Right:** Short channel device (W = 0.375 µm, L = 0.25 µm)

Even though both devices have the **same W/L ratio**, the short-channel device exhibits **lower I<sub>D</sub>** because of **carrier velocity saturation**.

**Observation:**  
- In the long channel, I<sub>D</sub> increases quadratically with V<sub>GS</sub>.  
- In the short channel, the increase is **linear**, showing velocity-limited current flow.

### (b) I<sub>D</sub>–V<sub>DS</sub> Characteristics

**Figure 3:** I<sub>D</sub> vs V<sub>DS</sub> characteristics showing early saturation in short-channel devices  
![ID vs VDS Characteristics](images/velocity_dat_eff_idvsVds.png)

In **Figure 3**, the I<sub>D</sub>–V<sub>DS</sub> characteristics highlight the difference in how **current saturates**:

- **Long Channel (Left):**  
  Current saturation occurs due to **pinch-off**, and the maximum current is higher.

- **Short Channel (Right):**  
  The current saturates **earlier** and **at a lower value**, due to the **limitation of carrier velocity** at high fields (v<sub>sat</sub>).



---

## 5. Key Takeaways

1. **Velocity saturation** limits the drift velocity of carriers at high electric fields.
2. **Short-channel devices** operate under much higher electric fields, thus experiencing velocity saturation earlier.
3. **(IMP)** Even for **identical W/L ratios**, the **peak I<sub>D</sub>** in short-channel devices is **smaller** because velocity (and hence current) cannot increase linearly with field.
4. **(IMP)** The **I–V curve changes shape** — from quadratic to linear — as we move from long-channel to short-channel regimes.










# CMOS Inverter: Static and Dynamic Behavior Analysis

## 1. Introduction

A **CMOS inverter** is the fundamental building block of all digital integrated circuits.  
It consists of a **p-channel MOSFET (PMOS)** and an **n-channel MOSFET (NMOS)** connected in a complementary fashion.

When the input (Vin) is **low**, the PMOS conducts and NMOS is OFF, producing a **logic high** at the output (Vout).  
When the input is **high**, the NMOS conducts and PMOS is OFF, producing a **logic low** at the output.

This complementary action ensures **low static power dissipation**, since ideally, only one transistor conducts at a time.

---

## 2. CMOS Inverter Circuit

**Figure 1** shows the schematic representation of a CMOS inverter. The input voltage (Vin) is applied to both gates, while the output (Vout) is taken at the common drain node. The load capacitance **C<sub>L</sub>** represents parasitic and interconnect capacitance.

## 3. Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)

The **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** shows the relationship between **Vout** and **Vin**. It defines the static behavior of the inverter.

- For **Vin = 0 V**, PMOS is **ON**, NMOS is **OFF**, and **Vout = VDD**.  
- For **Vin = VDD**, PMOS is **OFF**, NMOS is **ON**, and **Vout = 0 V**.  
- Between these two extremes, both transistors conduct partially — the transition region where switching occurs.

**Figure 2:** DC Voltage Transfer Characteristic of CMOS Inverter  
![VTC of CMOS Inverter](images/vtc_of_cmos_inv.png)

The **VTC curve** is crucial for determining:
- **Switching Threshold (Vm)** — the point where Vin = Vout.  
- **Noise Margins** — which quantify the inverter’s immunity to noise.

---

## 4. Transient Response

The **transient simulation** shows the dynamic behavior of the inverter when Vin is switched between logic levels.

- When **Vin rises**, NMOS turns ON and pulls the output to **0 V** (fall transition).  
- When **Vin falls**, PMOS turns ON and pulls the output to **VDD** (rise transition).  
- The load capacitance (C<sub>L</sub>) causes finite rise and fall times, determining propagation delay.

**Figure 3:** Transient Response of CMOS Inverter  
![Transient Simulation](images/transient_analysis_cmos_inv.png)

The inverter behaves as a **time-dependent switch**, charging and discharging C<sub>L</sub> through the transistor resistances.

---

## 5. Switching Threshold (Vm)

The **switching threshold (Vm)** is the input voltage at which:
\[
V_{in} = V_{out}
\]
At this point, **both PMOS and NMOS are partially ON**, and the currents through them are equal:
\[
I_{Dn} = I_{Dp}
\]

**Figure 4:** Switching Threshold Analysis (V<sub>in</sub> = V<sub>out</sub>)  
![Switching Threshold Plot](images/switchin_threshold_cmos_inv.png)

A well-balanced inverter has **Vm ≈ VDD/2**, ensuring symmetric noise margins and balanced rise/fall times.

---

## 5. Switching Threshold (Vm)

The **switching threshold (Vm)** is the input voltage at which:
\[
V_{in} = V_{out}
\]
At this point, **both PMOS and NMOS are partially ON**, and the currents through them are equal:
\[
I_{Dn} = I_{Dp}
\]

**Figure 4:** Switching Threshold Analysis (V<sub>in</sub> = V<sub>out</sub>)  
![Switching Threshold Plot](images/switchin_threshold_cmos_inv.png)

A well-balanced inverter has **Vm ≈ VDD/2**, ensuring symmetric noise margins and balanced rise/fall times.

---

## 6. Effect of Transistor Sizing on Vm

The **ratio of PMOS to NMOS widths (W<sub>p</sub>/W<sub>n</sub>)** determines the **switching threshold** of the inverter.

- **Increasing W<sub>p</sub>/L<sub>p</sub>** → stronger PMOS → shifts **Vm upward**  
- **Increasing W<sub>n</sub>/L<sub>n</sub>** → stronger NMOS → shifts **Vm downward**

**Key Objective:**  
Achieve **Vm ≈ VDD/2** for a balanced inverter by properly sizing PMOS and NMOS.

**Figure 5:** Effect of PMOS/NMOS Width on Switching Threshold  
![Effect of Width on Vm](images/eff_of_width_on_swotching_threshold.png)


From the table:
- Increasing PMOS width (W<sub>p</sub>) **raises** the switching threshold Vm.
- Rise time decreases (stronger PMOS charging), while fall time increases slightly.
- The **optimal W<sub>p</sub>/W<sub>n</sub> ratio** is typically **2–3**, ensuring Vm ≈ VDD/2.
